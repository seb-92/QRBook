# QRBook ðŸ“²ðŸ“–
QRBook is a mobile application in the Kotlin language that facilitates borrowing books from the library. The user can easily reserve a book in the system by scanning the QR code on a book. The application connects to a local server with a database to access and update information about borrowed books.

## Application:

* __Availability of books__: If the book is available, a button appears for the user to borrow it. If the code of an already owned book is scanned, the user can return his book. If the book turns out to be occupied, the user can only return to the previous page of the application.
